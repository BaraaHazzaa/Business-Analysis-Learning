# Business Analysis Guide

## 1. Introduction to Business Analysis

### Definition
**Business Analysis (BA):** The process of identifying an organization's needs and determining the best solutions to meet them. It involves a structured framework to understand needs deeply, define requirements, assess change impacts, and deliver aligned solutions.

**Key Flow:** Grasp business needs → Document requirements → Evaluate change effects → Ensure solutions fit organizational goals.

**Solutions Examples:**
- New software/products
- Process improvements
- Organizational changes (e.g., team restructuring)
- Strategic plans
- Policy development

**Purpose:** Avoids guesswork; ensures efforts lead to meaningful, goal-aligned outcomes.

### Example
A company identifies inefficiencies in inventory management and uses BA to implement an automated system, reducing errors and costs.
